reporting
=========

Automatic reporting tools:

Idea is to create python scripts that run daily (perhaps weekly and sometimes monthly) on the DW with the outputs
to a report or presentation.

Good for proto-typing some of what may end up in the portal?

This will be a bit messy.  There are a few unknowns on the best method, but the idea is to keep things relatively
modular (i.e., small) and then group scripts/plots togther when forming reports.

If we do this we should be able to get something up and running quickly, with the idea that we can add/chop and change
as we go into the future.

Current ideas: 1. whack in various notebooks which do the DW data grab and plots
               2. setup reporting notebooks, which can then be converted to pdf/reveal html slideshow
               3. test this with asx data
